# calculadora 

In this exercise, I tried to do a Functional Calculator with 3 buttons : 
'Calcular' = This button serves to make the operation happen
'CE' = This one cleans the inputs and the result
'Up' = This one was made to equal the value of the 'Numero 1' input and the result,and after that it will continue the operation
